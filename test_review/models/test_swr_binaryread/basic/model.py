SWR Binary File Reading Utilities Demonstration

This script demonstrates FloPy's SWR (Surface Water Routing) binary file reading utilities.
Key concepts demonstrated:
- SwrStage: Reading stage (water level) data from binary files
- SwrBudget: Reading flow budgets from SWR simulations
- SwrFlow: Reading flow velocity data between stream segments
- SwrExchange: Reading groundwater-surface water exchange rates
- SwrStructure: Reading hydraulic structure flow data
- SwrObs: Reading observation data from SWR models

SWR is MODFLOW's surface water routing module for simulating:
- Stream networks and flow routing
- Surface water-groundwater interaction
- Hydraulic structures (weirs, gates, pumps)
- Channel/overbank flow processes
- Stream stage and discharge relationships
