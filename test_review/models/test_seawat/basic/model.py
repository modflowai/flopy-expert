SEAWAT Density-Dependent Flow and Transport Demonstration

This script demonstrates FloPy's SEAWAT capabilities for coupled groundwater flow
and transport modeling with variable density effects. Based on the original test_seawat.py 
from FloPy autotest using the classic Henry saltwater intrusion problem.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- SEAWAT model setup for density-dependent flow
- Henry problem benchmark configuration
- Coupled MODFLOW-MT3D modeling approach
- Variable Density Flow (VDF) package setup
- Source/sink mixing (SSM) for transport boundary conditions
- Professional saltwater intrusion modeling workflows

The test addresses:
- Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers
- Density-driven flow processes
- Coupled flow and transport phenomena
- Benchmark problem validation
- Professional coastal hydrogeology applications
