MODFLOW STR (Stream Routing) Package Demonstration

This script demonstrates the STR (Stream Routing) package in MODFLOW-2005, which simulates
surface water flow through stream networks. Key concepts demonstrated:
- STR package setup and configuration for stream routing
- Stream network connectivity and topology definition
- Stream-aquifer interaction modeling
- Flow routing through channel networks
- Boundary condition management for streams
- Stream stage and discharge relationships

The STR package is used for:
- Modeling surface water-groundwater interactions
- Stream flow routing and channel hydraulics
- Water rights and allocation studies
- Flood routing and stream management
- Ecosystem flow analysis and environmental studies
