=== SWI2 Salt Water Intrusion Package Demonstration ===

1. SWI2 Package Overview
----------------------------------------
  SWI2 capabilities:
    • Density-dependent groundwater flow
    • Sharp interface approximation
    • Multiple density zones (freshwater to seawater)
    • Transient interface movement
    • Stratified and continuous density options
    • Tip and toe tracking for interface

2. Creating Coastal Aquifer Model
----------------------------------------
  Model type: Coastal aquifer cross-section
  Grid: 1×1×50 cells
  Domain length: 2500m (2.5km)
  Aquifer thickness: 40m

3. Model Discretization
----------------------------------------
  Stress periods: 2
    Period 1: Steady-state initial conditions
    Period 2: 3650 days (10.0 years) transient

4. Basic Package Configuration
----------------------------------------
  Active cells: 49
  Ocean boundary: Column 50 (constant head)
  Initial gradient: 0.5m inland to 0m at coast

5. Aquifer Properties
----------------------------------------
  Hydraulic conductivity: 10.0 m/d
  Vertical K: 1.0 m/d
  Specific storage: 1.0e-05 1/m
  Specific yield: 0.20

6. Recharge Configuration
----------------------------------------
  Recharge rate: 1 mm/day on land
  Annual recharge: 365 mm/year
  No recharge on ocean cell

7. Pumping Well Configuration
----------------------------------------
  Well location: 500m from coast
  Pumping rate: 50 m³/day (transient period)
  Purpose: Freshwater supply well

8. SWI2 Salt Water Intrusion Setup
----------------------------------------
  Density zones: 2
    Zone 1: Freshwater (ρ = 1000 kg/m³)
    Zone 2: Seawater (ρ = 1025 kg/m³)
  Interface tracking: Sharp interface
  Stratified flow approximation

9. Interface Dynamics
----------------------------------------
  Ghyben-Herzberg relation:
    • Interface depth = 40 × freshwater head
    • Based on density difference
    • ρf/Δρ ≈ 40 for fresh/seawater

  Interface movement factors:
    • Recharge pushes interface seaward
    • Pumping pulls interface landward
    • Tides cause interface fluctuation
    • Sea level rise moves interface inland

10. Solver Configuration
----------------------------------------
  Solver: PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient)
  Max iterations: 100
  Head closure: 1e-4 m
  Residual closure: 1e-3 m³/d

11. Output Control
----------------------------------------
  Save heads: Initial and final
  Save budget: Initial and final
  Zeta (interface) output: Every time step

    • Environmental protection: Ecosystem salinity control

14. Monitoring and Management
----------------------------------------
  Monitoring strategies:
    • Multi-level monitoring wells
    • Electrical conductivity profiling
    • Geophysical surveys (EM, resistivity)
    • Water quality sampling
    • Interface depth measurements

  Management options:
    • Pumping optimization
    • Injection barriers
    • Artificial recharge
    • Pumping redistribution
    • Scavenger wells

15. Climate Change Impacts
----------------------------------------
  Climate change impacts:
    • Sea level rise: Direct interface movement inland
    • Reduced recharge: Less freshwater pressure
    • Increased pumping: Higher water demand
    • Storm surges: Temporary intrusion events
    • Drought periods: Reduced freshwater lens
    • Coastal flooding: Surface saltwater infiltration
