# Experimental Models

This directory contains experimental versions of the SFR+AG model created during development.

## Files
- `model_with_sfr.py` - First attempt at SFR integration
- `model_sfr_working.py` - Working version with convergence fixes
- `model_output_sfr/` - Output from SFR experiments
- `model_output_working/` - Output from working model

These files are preserved for reference but the main working model is in the parent directory's `model.py`.
