Specific Discharge Calculation and Visualization Demonstration

This script demonstrates FloPy's specific discharge calculation capabilities for detailed
groundwater flow analysis and visualization. Based on the original test_specific_discharge.py
from FloPy autotest.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Specific discharge calculation from face flows
- Extended budget analysis with boundary conditions  
- Vector field visualization in map view and cross-section
- MODFLOW 2005 vs MODFLOW 6 comparison
- Water balance verification at cell level
- Professional groundwater flow analysis workflows

The test addresses:
- Small synthetic test case with comprehensive boundary conditions
- Cell-by-cell flow budget analysis
- Specific discharge vector field computation
- Flow visualization and interpretation
- Quality assurance through water balance checks
