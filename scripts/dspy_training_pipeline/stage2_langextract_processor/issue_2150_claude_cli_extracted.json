  "problem": "Cell centroids calculated by shapefile_to_xcyc are incorrect when processing a mesh/grid from a shapefile, showing significant differences compared to geopandas (which produces correct centroids). This causes issues with interpolation algorithms in pilot-points and structural-overlays calibration.",
