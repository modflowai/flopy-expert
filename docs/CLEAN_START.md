# FloPy Semantic Database - Clean Start

## What We've Done

### 1. Removed the Mess
- Dropped all old tables with confusing multiple embeddings
- Removed unused tables (relationships, usage_patterns)
- Cleared out partial/incomplete data

### 2. Created Clean Schema
- **modules** - Core table with single embedding per module
- **packages** - Aggregated view of packages across models  
- **workflows** - For tutorial/example patterns
- **processing_log** - Track file processing for CI/CD

### 3. Key Improvements
- ONE embedding per entity (combines code + semantic meaning)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Built-in full-text search with tsvector
- Proper indexes for performance
- Processing log for incremental updates

## What's Next

### Phase 1: Build the Processing Pipeline
Create a robust processor that:
- Processes files in batches with checkpoints
- Uses Gemini for ALL files (no shortcuts!)
- Handles failures gracefully
- Tracks progress in processing_log

### Phase 2: Process Entire Repository
- Start with core modflow packages
- Then mf6, mfusg, mt3d
- Finally utilities and plotting
- Target: 100% coverage of 376+ files

### Phase 3: Package Aggregation
After all modules are processed:
- Group by package_code
- Create package-level descriptions
- Handle cross-model packages (e.g., WEL in modflow/mf6/mfusg)

### Phase 4: Workflow Extraction
- Parse example notebooks
- Extract common usage patterns
- Create searchable workflows

## Current Status
✅ Clean database schema created
✅ All indexes in place
✅ Ready for processing
❌ No data yet - starting fresh

## Next Action
Create the production-ready processing pipeline that will populate this clean schema with high-quality semantic data from the entire FloPy repository.
